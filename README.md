  <br>When designing software, testing should be included during every stage of development. It helps reduce risk and dynamic testing time, save money, and increase quality (Hambling, 2019). Test should be reviewed by peers before being pushed to production as sometimes a new set of eyes can catch errors. It is also important the companies offer testing trainings or seminars to employees to help them employ best practices. <br>
<br>Tests should be based on users needs which can be found in their work products. Listed requirements should be carefully analyzed to determine what are functional and non-functional. They should also be examined for possible inconsistencies or errors as sometimes users don’t understand that they are requesting is not technically possible (Hambling, 2019). In situations like these, it’s best to make note and share these concerns with the Scrum Master so they can work with the Product Owner and Client to improve their requests. <br>
<br>Tests are also important for ensuring that programs are functional and secure. JUnit5 allows for unit/component testing in Java, which can validate and verify functionality (Garcia, 2017).
